2.What all permissions are there in LINUX. State all permissions and different way of changing permissions.

Ans. There are three kind of permissions in LINUX. 
      a.Read (r)
      b.Write (w)
      c.Execute (x)
There are 3 users to a particular file to which we provide permissions. 
Others Users and Group.
to check the permission we use command : ls -l filename
To change the permission we have two methods: 1.Symbollic 2.Octal numbers
In symbollic we use + sign to add permission and - to remove along with the user and the permissions, Eg: $chmod o+wx,u-x,g=rx testfile ,It will give other permission to write and execute, and remove permision from user to execute and group to only read and execute. 
In Octal number represtation we use ocatl numbers to add or remove $chmod 743 testfile,7 is to provide all permision to other, 4 is read to user and 3 is wx to group.



3.Create a folder name OSOC and inside that another folder Inductions and now create a file task.txt, inside Inductions with some contents. Now copy into another folder Workshop in OSOC.

Ans:~mkdir OSOC
OSOC~mkdir Inductions
OSOC~mkdir Workshop
OSOC~cd Inductions
OSOC/Induction~ cat > task.txt
>This is my OSOC Induction task File. I wanted to be part of the club because i wanted to contribute to open souce. It will lead to reduce human effort and make things available easily.
OSOC/Induction~ cp task.txt ../Workshop/file.txt
OSOC/Induction~cd ../
OSOC/~ cd Workshop
OSOC/Workshop/~ ls
file.txt



4.I want to check whether my system is connected to any network or not, give an appropriate command for that. 

Ans. We can use ping command.



5.How to change password for another user in Linux?

the , type, passwd username

Enter new unix password:
Retypr the password:
Password changed successfully.


6.Write shell script to sort an array. Input should be taken from User.

Ans: 
vi touch.c
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
        int n,j;
        printf("Enter how many Elements");
        scanf("%d",&n);
        int a[n],i,temp;
        for(i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
                scanf("%d",&a[i]);
        }
        for(i=0;i<n-1;i++)
        {
                for(j=0;j<n-1;j++)
                {
                        if(a[j]>a[j+1])
                        {
                                temp=a[j];
                                a[j]=a[j+1];
                                a[j+2]=temp;
                                }
                }
        }
        printf("\nThe sorted array is:");
       for(i=0;i<n;i++)
       {
                printf("%d ",a[i]);
       }
        return 0;
}


esc :w
esc :wq
 gcc touch.c -o sort
 ./sort
Enter how may elements: 5
5 4 2 1 2
The sorted array is: 1 2 2 4 5




7.Using shell script write a program to reverse the string. 
vi reverse.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
        char Str[100], RevStr[100];
        int i, j, len;

        printf("\n Please Enter any String :  ");
        gets(Str);

        j = 0;
        len = strlen(Str);

        for (i = len - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        {
                RevStr[j++] = Str[i];
        }
        RevStr[i] = '\0';

        printf("\n String after Reversing = %s", RevStr);

        return 0;
}

esc: w
esc: wq
gcc reverse.c -o reverse
./reverse
enter the string ankur
String after reverse is rukna.


8.What is concept of Branching? How it is useful ?Explain with working examples.
Ans: Branches are pointers to a specific commit. 
Branches are of two types: Local Branches,Remote-tracking branches. There is always a master branch which contains all the codes. Suppose we want some changes but not sure to add to master branch or not, then we make another branch. Once we are sure to add those code we merge the local branch into master  branch.
